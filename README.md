# irb.rocks

This repo includes a blog I used to write called irb.rocks. I won't write any new article in this blog. I'll do in other blog I'm working :).

I want to keep all the articles because I still have some visits and I think the content of the posts is useful!

To download the Ghost blog, I've just used wget. I needed to change some link refences, but it was really easy.

```
wget --mirror -p --html-extension --convert-links https://irb.rocks
```
